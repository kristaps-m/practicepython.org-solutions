This is my solutions to https://www.practicepython.org/exercises

When I first started to learn programming.
I liked this website so much I completed all challenges two times.
First time as a beginner and a second time practising on edabit.com
To work with these files you need to download Python:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
And use your favorite Integrated development environment.

And then install libraries using pip.
You need to open python scripts folder and open cmd there.
In cmd type "pip3 install 'library name'"
